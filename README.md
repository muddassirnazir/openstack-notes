The OpenStack project is an open source cloud computing platform that supports all types
of cloud environments. The project aims for simple implementation, massive scalability, and
a rich set of features. Cloud computing experts from around the world contribute to the
project.
OpenStack provides an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) solution through a variety of complemental
services. Each service offers an application programming interface (API) that facilitates
this integration.

#Installation Guide : 
Open-Stack does not require a significant amount of resources and the following minimum requirements should support a proof-of-concept environment with core services and several instances:

• Controller Node: 1 processor, 2 GB memory, and 5 GB storage

• Network Node: 1 processor, 512 MB memory, and 5 GB storage

• Compute Node: 1 processor, 2 GB memory, and 10 GB storage

To minimize clutter and provide more resources for OpenStack, a minimal installation of your Linux distribution is recommended.

Do not try my guide in production. I am not making any promises. 
I suggest you test it first. A contribution is expected ifi you find anomalies and errors. Thank you.
